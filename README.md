# Phishield Project

**Phishield** is an AI-powered tool designed to detect phishing scams. It analyses when a user sends a link or takes a picture of one to determine if it is potentially malicious.

## Current Status
The project is still in progress. Some features are under development, and there are occasional issues with missing files on the local machine.
